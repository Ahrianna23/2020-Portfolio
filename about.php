                Hi there,
                <br><br>
                My name is Ahrianna Daniels and I am a web developer currently working at FullBeauty Brands. As an experienced Web Developer and Designer with a demonstrated history of working in many industries from healthcare to the apparel and fashion industry, I dedicate energy to creating beautiful web applications. When I first started my studies for web development I went with in a passion to excel and be one of the strongest developers amongest my peers. Today I find myself coding for fun, taking on small projects to help retain the knowledge I gained and go further with career development.
                <br><br>
                During my senior year of college, a team of which I was apart of entered a national showdown for the best senior project. My team partnered with a local business to essentially rebrand something that has been around for more than 10 years. We gave the business a packaged deal which included a Website, Social media accounts, manuals, and new print designs for menus and business cards and much more. Iâ€™m happy to say we place in 3rd place in the nation, and number 1 in our university.
                <br><br>
                Soon after that accomplishment, I began freelancing, at times partnering with a few of my peers from university, taking on projects from tutoring to web development. I constantly aim to improve on my career and what I can bring to a new team! 
                <br><br>
                I bring a strong work ethic with me and a desire to learn as much as I can.
